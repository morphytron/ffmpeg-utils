# ffmpeg-utils

This project started out as a personal need to study for the AWS Professional Solutions Architecture Certification.
I had access to multiple courses as mp4 files, but I wanted to use VLC to listen and cast to my TV, where iTunes fails miserably.  While iTunes has sorting functionality, sometimes, it would not sort in the correct order.  I also wanted each course to alternate between the next section of the course so that it was like a day at the University: aka., I would be exposed to 3 different lectures.

## Three main functions
* Create mp3 files from mp4s as a batch operation.
* Combine all these mp3 files from the generated txt file into a single Mp3 to listen on your mobile phone.
* Sort mp4 files using the file system (mv or cp command) correctly renaming the file names so that it keeps the correct order based on title.
